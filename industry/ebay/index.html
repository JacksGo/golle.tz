                    eBay is a global, online retail marketplace and a household name that transcends generations.
                    eBay was originally founded to facilitate the resale of pre-owned goods, but has since expanded into a wide array of different markets, sectors, and enthusiast niches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I joined eBay in the summer of 2023 as a front-end engineer specializing in React.
                    Soon after I started, however, it became clear that the role I had accepted was very different from the one described during interviews.
                    I took this as a challenge, though, and strove at every opportunity to rise to the occasion.
                    Over the course of my time with the company, I worked on a variety of projects—some of which required me to learn the company’s internal front-end framework, Marko, on the fly—and fulfilled a wide variety of other, full-stack developer functions.
                    I became well-versed in our build pipelines and automation, rewrote test suites from the ground up, and learned the ins and outs of a plethora of internal tools, covering everything from content security policies and localization to production diagnostics and accessibility tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my tenure, I made many significant front-end contributions on a variety of projects, including building new experiences for the eBay home page, Collectibles, and the eBay Vault.
                    I also leveraged my extensive front-end experience to spearhead improvements to legacy code, proposing refactors and incremental upgrades to parts of our codebase before they became impediments.
                    Additionally, I found particular meaning in advocating for process improvements on behalf of my peers, promoting a healthier, more developer-centric culture in our team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My time at eBay has given me a wealth of new and unexpected experiences, and deepened my appreciation for the challenges of engineering at scale.
                    I look forward to carrying these lessons with me into my next role and beyond.
                </p>
